    "\n",
    "1. Geogrid: creates domains\n",
    "    - Input from  namelis.wps (&geogrid part - and max_dom -)\n",
    "    - Based on static data – the temporal part of namelist.wps does not affect geogrid\n",
    "    - Creates geo_em.d01.nc (1 file per domain)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ungrib: Unpacks GRIB files for boundary and initial conditions\n",
    "    - Input from  namelis.wps (&ungrib part)\n",
    "    - Requires the correct variable table (“Vtable”) translator\n",
    "    - Creates intermediate files called FILE:* or the prefix you have on  namelist.wps -> prefix = 'FILE'\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Metgrid: Interpolates horizontally intermediate files (FILE:*) from ungrib to WRF grid defined in geogrid\n",
    "    - Input from namelis.wps (&metgrib part) fg_name = 'FILE’\n",
    "    - Creates files met_em.d01.* (multiple files per domain)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Real: Interpolates vertically metgrid files into WRF’s vertical coordinate\n",
    "    - Input from namelist.input (&domains section)\n",
    "    - Creates wrfinput_d01 and wrfbdy_d01 (1 wrf_input per domain, 1 wrfbdy usually). Sometimes creates (wrflowinp_d0* 1 per domain)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. WRF: Produces the forecast / simulation\n",
    "    - Input from namelist.input (all sections)\n",
    "    - Needs input files from real\n",
    "    - Creates output files wrfout_d01_2023-01-22_12:00:00 (for each domain)\n"
